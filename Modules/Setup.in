# The file Setup is used by the makesetup script to construct the files
# Makefile and config.c, from Makefile.pre and config.c.in,
# respectively.  The file Setup itself is initially copied from
# Setup.in; once it exists it will not be overwritten, so you can edit
# Setup to your heart's content.  One possibility is to overwrite it
# with a copy of Setup.sgi or Setup.sunos[45] before you start editing.
# Note that Makefile.pre is created from Makefile.pre.in by the toplevel
# configure script.

# (VPATH notes: Setup and Makefile.pre are in the build directory, as
# are Makefile and config.c; Setup.in and config.c.in are in the source
# directory.)

# Each line in this file describes one or more optional modules.
# Comment out lines to suppress modules.
# Lines have the following structure:
#
# <module> ... [<objectfile> ...] [<cpparg> ...] [<library> ...]
#
# <objectfile> is anything ending in .o
# <cpparg> is anything starting with -I, -D, -U or -C
# <library> is anything ending in .a or beginning with -l or -L
# <module> is anything else but should be a valid Python
# identifier (letters, digits, underscores, beginning with non-digit)
#
# Lines can also have the form
#
# <name> = <value>
#
# which defines a Make variable definition inserted into Makefile.in

# NOTE: As a standard policy, as many modules as can be supported by a
# platform should be present.  The distribution comes with all modules
# enabled that are supported by most platforms and don't require you
# to ftp sources from elsewhere.  To make this easier for SGI
# platforms, you can copy Setup.sgi to Setup (or edit Makefile.in.in
# to use Setup.sgi instead of Setup).

# Modules that should always be present (non UNIX dependent)

array arraymodule.o	# array objects

parser parsermodule.o	# raw interface to the Python parser
posix posixmodule.o	# posix (UNIX) system calls
regex regexmodule.o regexpr.o	# Regular expressions, GNU Emacs style
strop stropmodule.o	# fast string operations implemented in C
struct structmodule.o	# binary structure packing/unpacking
time timemodule.o	# time operations and variables


# Modules with some UNIX dependencies -- on by default.
# (If you have a really backward UNIX, select and socket may not be
# supported...)

fcntl fcntlmodule.o	# fcntl(2) and ioctl(2)
pwd pwdmodule.o		# pwd(3) 
grp grpmodule.o		# grp(3)
crypt cryptmodule.o	# crypt(3)
select selectmodule.o	# select(2); not on ancient System V
socket socketmodule.o	# socket(2); not on ancient System V


# Some more UNIX dependent modules -- off by default, since these
# are not supported by all UNIX systems.

#dbm dbmmodule.o 	# dbm(3) may require -lndbm or similar
#nis nismodule.o 	# Sun yellow pages -- not everywhere


# Multimedia modules -- on by default.
# These represent audio samples or images as strings

audioop audioop.o	# Operations on audio samples
imageop imageop.o	# Operations on images
rgbimg rgbimgmodule.o   # Read SGI RGB image files (but coded portably)


# The stdwin module provides a simple, portable (between X11 and Mac)
# windowing interface.  You need to ftp the STDWIN library, e.g. from
# ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/stdwin.  The STDWIN variable must point to the
# STDWIN toplevel directory.  The ARCH variable must be set to the
# architecture identifier used to build STDWIN.  NB if you combine this
# with the gl module on an SGI machine, you should replace "-lX11" with
# "-lX11_s".

# The md5 module implements the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5
# Message-Digest Algorithm, described in RFC 1321.  The necessary files
# md5c.c and md5.h are included here.

# The mpz module interfaces to the GNU Multiple Precision library.
# You need to ftp the GNU MP library.  
# The GMP variable must point to the GMP source directory.
# This was originally written and tested against GMP 1.2.  I have
# compiled it against GMP 1.3.2 (the latest I believe) and it seems to
# work OK, but I haven't tested it thoroughly (lacking knowledge about
# it).

# SGI IRIX specific modules -- off by default.
# Switch this on if you have an SGI machine.
# Note that some required libraries and header files aren't always
# installed; you may be better off switching on only 'fm' and 'gl'
# (Font Manager and Graphics Library).

#                               # ADD THESE FOR IRIX5:

# The FORMS library, by Mark Overmars, implements user interface
# components such as dialogs and buttons using SGI's GL and FM
# libraries.  You must ftp the FORMS library separately from
# ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/SGI/FORMS.  It was tested with FORMS 2.2a.
# The FORMS variable must point to the FORMS subdirectory of the forms
# toplevel directory.

# Thread module -- works on SGI IRIX and on SunOS 5.x (SOLARIS) only.
# Note that you must have configured (and built!) Python with the
# --with-thread option passed to the configure script for this to work.
