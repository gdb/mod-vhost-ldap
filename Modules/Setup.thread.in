# This file is transmogrified into Setup.thread by config.status.

# Its purpose is to automatically enable the thread module by default
# unless the the --without-threads argument is given to the configure
# script.

# *NOTE*: if the configure script decides it can't support threads,
# the thread module will still be enabled and cause compile errors.
# The solution is to use --without-threads on platforms that don't
# support threads.
