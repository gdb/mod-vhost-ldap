This directory contains a Makefile that will create a couple of python-related
applications (fullblown OSX .app applications, that is) in /Applications/Python,
and a hidden helper application Python.app inside the Python.framework. In addition
it has a target "installmacsubtree" that installs the relevant portions of the
Mac subtree into the Python.framework.

It is normally invoked indirectly through the main Makefile, as the last step
in the sequence
1. configure --enable-framework
2. make
3. make frameworkinstall
4. make osxapps

The interesting targets in the makefile are:
installmacsubtree - explained above,
dontinstallmacsubtree - Put only a .pth file into the framework (pointing to this
	sourcetree), which may be easier for development,
install_all - install all three .app applications,
install_Python - install the hidden interpreter .app into the framework,
install_PythonLauncher - install the user-visible script launch helper
install_IDE - install the IDE
installunixprograms - install symlinks/scripts mimicking normal unix Python into
	/usr/local.


Something to take note of is that the ".rsrc" files in the distribution are not
actually resource files, they're AppleSingle encoded resource files.
