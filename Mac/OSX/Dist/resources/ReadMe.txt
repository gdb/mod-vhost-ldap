This package will install MacPython 2.5a0 for Mac OS X
10.3.

Installation requires approximately 20 MB of disk
space, ignore the message that it will take zero bytes.

You must install onto your current boot disk, even
though the installer does not enforce this, otherwise
things will not work.

MacPython consists of the Python programming language
interpreter, plus a set of programs to allow easy
access to it for Mac users (an integrated development
environment, a Python extension package manager), plus
a set of pre-built extension modules that open up
specific Macintosh technologies to Python programs
(Carbon, AppleScript, Quicktime, more).

The installer puts the applications in MacPython-2.5 in
your Applications folder, command-line tools in
/usr/local/bin and the underlying machinery in
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.

The PythonIDE application has a Help command that gets
you started quickly with MacPython and contains
references to other documentation.
