This package will install MacPython 2.3rc1+ for Mac OS X 10.2. Installation
on the Panther preview may work, on 10.1 or earlier will not work.

Installation requires approximately 20 MB of disk space, ignore the
message that it will take zero bytes. You must install onto your current
boot disk, even though the installer does not enforce this, otherwise
things will not work.

MacPython consists of the Python programming language interpreter, 
plus a set of programs to allow easy access to it for Mac users (an
integrated development environment, a Python extension package manager),
plus a set of pre-built extension modules that open up specific
Macintosh technologies to Python programs (Carbon, AppleScript,
Quicktime, more).

The installer puts the applications in MacPython-2.3 in your
Applications folder, command-line tools in /usr/local/bin and the
underlying machinery in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework.

The PythonIDE application has a Help command that gets you started
quickly with MacPython and contains references to other documentation.

general at http://www.python.org.
