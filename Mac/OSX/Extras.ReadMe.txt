This folder contains examples of Python usage and useful scripts and tools.

You should be aware that these are not Macintosh-specific but are shared
among Python on all platforms, so there are some that only run on Windows
or Unix or another platform, and/or make little sense on a Macintosh.

Some examples can be run from within the PythonIDE, but many will require
that you start them from the command line or with PythonLauncher. In the
latter case, you can supply any needed command line arguments by holding
the "alt" key while dragging the script to PythonLauncher (or while
double-clicking the script, if PythonLauncher is set as the default application
to open Python scripts with).
