This folder contains examples of Python usage and useful scripts and tools.

You should be aware that these are not Macintosh-specific but are shared
among Python on all platforms, so there are some that only run on Windows
or Unix or another platform, and/or make little sense on a Macintosh.

Some examples can be run from within the PythonIDE, but many will require
that you start them from the command line, or supply command-line arguments
by holding down the "alt" key when double-clicking them.
