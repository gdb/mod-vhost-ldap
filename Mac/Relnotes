Changes in 2.0b1 since 1.5.2
----------------------------

Unfortunately I have messed my administration up, so I can't give complete
Mac-specific release notes for the changes in this release. So, I will
have to leave it at the highlights:

- 68K support has been dropped, this release is PPC only.
- Threads support (through standard Python threads module).
- Appearance support through App module and added calls in many other modules.
- Navigation Services support, with macfs StandardFile calls transparently
  replaced by their NavServices counterparts.
- Offscreen QuickDraw support through Qdoffs module.
- Drag manager support (Drag module).
- Much better CGI support, see :Mac:Tools:CGI.
- Better OSA/AppleEvent support.
