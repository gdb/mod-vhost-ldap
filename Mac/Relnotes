Changes since 1.6a1
-------------------

- All core-Python changes, plus a few from after 1.6a2, approximately as the
  Python CVS tree was at May 5.
- The threading performance bug has been fixed.
- Tkinter is included again (yeah!), but only lightly tested. Please report
  findings to the mailing list.
- macfsn.py is auto-imported on startup (unless disabled with a new option).
  This retrofits macfs.StandardGetFile() and friends to use Navigation Services
  in stead of the old Standard File dialogs.
- I think all installer problems have been fixed. Please report if not so.
