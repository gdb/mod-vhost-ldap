Compiling Python Under MPW C
============================

This directory contains the Makefiles, source files and scripts
required to compile Python under MPW C.

Compiling:
----------
the "buildall" file at the top level is an MPW script
which rebuilds the entire Python source.

To build, start the MPW Shell and select the Worksheet window.
Go to top level directory of the Python source tree.
Type: buildall<ENTER>

To rebuild:
Type: buildall clean<ENTER>
Type: buildall<ENTER>

Configuration:
--------------
The files "Makefile", "config.h", "Modules:config.c" and
"Modules:Makefile" are normally configured and/or generated 
automagically under Unix.

Macintosh programmers will have to be content with editing
these files manually to reflect their desired configuration.
The files provided here are examples only; Modules which 
made it into this version are those which required little or 
no modification.

Running:
--------
The top-level Makefile compiles Python as an MPW Tool.
You can then run Python interactively from within
the MPW Worksheet.

Diagnostics:
------------
If Python fails to run by aborting in file "Parser:grammar1.c",
at the end of the function "finddfa", line 46,
try defining the preprocessor symbol "MPW_881_BUG" in 
file "Parser:acceler.c", function "fixstate", line 107.

XXX Note that you have to edit test_grammar.py because of a bug
in int overflow det that I haven't found yet.
