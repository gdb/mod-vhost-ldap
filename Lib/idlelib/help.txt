** TIPS
========

Basic editing and navigation:

	Backspace deletes to the left; DEL deletes to the right
	Arrow keys and Page Up/Down to move around
	Home/End go to begin/end of line
	Control-Home/End go to begin/end of file
	Some Emacs or standard Windows bindings may work.
	Keybindings are selected in the Settings Dialog, look there.

Automatic indentation:

	After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by
	4 spaces (in the Python Shell window by one tab).  After
	certain keywords (break, return etc.) the next line is
	dedented.  In leading indentation, Backspace deletes up to 4
	spaces if they are there.  Tab inserts spaces (in the
	Python Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent Width
        See also the indent/dedent region commands in the edit menu.

Python Shell window:

	^C interrupts executing command
	^D sends end-of-file; closes window if typed at >>> prompt

    Command history:

	Alt-p retrieves previous command matching what you have typed
	Alt-n retrieves next
	Return while on any previous command retrieves that command
	Alt-/ (Expand word) is also useful here

Syntax colors:

	The coloring is applied in a background "thread", so you may
	occasionally see uncolorized text.  To change the color
	scheme, use the Settings/Highlighting dialog.

    Python default syntax colors:

	Keywords	orange
	Strings		green
	Comments	red
	Definitions	blue

    Shell default colors:

	Console output	brown
	stdout		blue
	stderr		dark green
	stdin		black

Other preferences:

	The font preferences, keybinding, and startup preferences can
	be changed using the Settings dialog.

Command line usage:
	
	Enter idle -h at the command prompt to get a usage message.
