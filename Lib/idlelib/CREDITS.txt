IDLEfork Credits
==================

Guido van Rossum, as well as being the creator of the Python language, was
the original creator of IDLE. His great work continues as both a contributor
to, and 'benevolent dictator for life' of Python and IDLE/IDLEfork.

The main developers who have been so far active on IDLEfork version 0.8.1 
and greater are, Guido van Rossum, Stephen M. Gava and Kurt B. Kaiser.

The IDLE fork project was initiated and brought up to version 0.7.1 by
David Scherer, Peter Schneider-Kamp and Nicholas Riley.

There are doubtless others who should be included here, especially those
who may have contributed to IDLE versions prior ot 0.8. Please contact
the IDLEfork coordinator to have yourself included here if you are one of
those I have missed! (contact details at http://idlefork.sourceforge.net)
