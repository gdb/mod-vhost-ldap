IDLEfork Credits
==================

Guido van Rossum, as well as being the creator of the Python language, is
the original creator of IDLE.  He also developed the RPC code and Remote
Debugger extension used in IDLEfork.

The IDLEfork project was initiated and brought up to version 0.7.1 primarily
by David Scherer, with help from Peter Schneider-Kamp and Nicholas Riley.
Bruce Sherwood has contributed considerable time testing and suggesting
improvements.

Besides Guido, the main developers who have been active on IDLEfork version
0.8.1 and later are Stephen M. Gava, who implemented the configuration GUI, and
Kurt B. Kaiser, who continued the integration of the RPC and remote debugger,
and made a number of usability enhancements.

Other contributors include Tony Lownds (Mac integration), and Chui Tey (RPC,
Debugger) 

Neal Norwitz and Josh Robb have submitted useful patches. 

There are others who should be included here, especially those who contributed
to IDLE versions prior to 0.8, principally Mark Hammond, Tim Peters, and Moshe
Zadka.  For additional details refer to NEWS.txt and Changelog.

Please contact the IDLEfork maintainer to have yourself included here if you
are one of those we missed!
