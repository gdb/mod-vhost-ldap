IDLEfork Credits
==================

Guido van Rossum, as well as being the creator of the Python language, is
the original creator of IDLE.  He also developed the RPC code and Remote
Debugger extension used in IDLEfork.

The IDLEfork project was initiated and brought up to version 0.7.1 primarily
by David Scherer, with help from Peter Schneider-Kamp and Nicholas Riley.
Bruce Sherwood has contributed considerable time testing and suggesting
improvements.

Besides Guido, the main developers who have been active on IDLEfork version
0.8.1 and later are Stephen M. Gava, who implemented the Configuration GUI, the
new configuration system, and the new About menu, and Kurt B. Kaiser, who
completed the integration of the RPC and remote debugger, implemented the
threaded subprocess, and made a number of usability enhancements.

Other contributors include Raymond Hettinger, Tony Lownds (Mac integration),
Neal Norwitz (code check and clean-up), and Chui Tey (RPC integration, debugger
integration and persistent breakpoints).

Hernan Foffani, Christos Georgiou, Martin v. Loewis, Jason Orendorff, Noam
Raphael, Josh Robb, Nigel Rowe, and Bruce Sherwood have submitted useful
patches.  Thanks, guys!

There are others who should be included here, especially those who contributed
to IDLE versions prior to 0.8, principally Mark Hammond, Jeremy Hylton,
Tim Peters, and Moshe Zadka.  For additional details refer to NEWS.txt and
Changelog.

Please contact the IDLEfork maintainer to have yourself included here if you
are one of those we missed!
