This directory only contains tests for outstanding bugs that cause
the interpreter to segfault.  Ideally this directory should always
be empty.  Sometimes it may not be easy to fix the underlying cause.

Each test should fail when run from the command line:

	./python Lib/test/crashers/weakref_in_del.py

Each test should have a link to the bug report:

	# http://python.org/sf/BUG#

Put as much info into a docstring or comments to help determine
the cause of the failure.  Particularly note if the cause is
system or environment dependent and what the variables are.
