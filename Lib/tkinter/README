Tommy Burnette <tnb2d@server.cs.virginia.edu> has created an
"official" version of Tkinter.py for Tk 4.0b3.  I have placed it on
ftp.cwi.nl in ftp/python/src/tk4inter.shar.  Note that this (probably)
isn't compatible with Tk 3.6, and explicitly tests for the Tk version
number (tkintermodule.c *is* compatible with both versions of Tk).
The shar file also contains a slightly modified version of Dialog.py.

Here are Tommy's notes:

> 	Here is an implementation of Tkinter.py that works with
> tk4.0b3.  I've used it on sunos4, solaris and Irix5.2 for a few weeks
> and it all seems to work okay.  It is an almalgam of patches put in by
> Steven Reiz <sreiz@aie.nl>, Guido vanRossum <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>
> and myself.  I can say now that probably not all of the widgets have
> been updated, and the ones that have been updated have not been
> completely updated (i.e. some new commands on Text widgets and such
> are not in yet).  So please post patches as you make them and if you
> have an "insurmountable" problems post those too and I'll see if I can
> help.  I've also included versions of tributton.c and studbutton.c
> that I've updated for Tk4.0b3 (in case you use those- I know I LOVE
> tributtons!).  Enjoy!

I placed the *Button.c files in a separate shar file in
ftp/python/contrib/tk4buttons.shar.
