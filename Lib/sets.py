"""Classes to represent arbitrary sets (including sets of sets).

This module implements sets using dictionaries whose values are
ignored.  The usual operations (union, intersection, deletion, etc.)
are provided as both methods and operators.

The following classes are provided:

BaseSet -- All the operations common to both mutable and immutable
    sets. This is an abstract class, not meant to be directly
    instantiated.

Set -- Mutable sets, subclass of BaseSet; not hashable.

ImmutableSet -- Immutable sets, subclass of BaseSet; hashable.
    An iterable argument is mandatory to create an ImmutableSet.

_TemporarilyImmutableSet -- Not a subclass of BaseSet: just a wrapper
    around a Set, hashable, giving the same hash value as the
    immutable set equivalent would have.  Do not use this class
    directly.

Only hashable objects can be added to a Set. In particular, you cannot
really add a Set as an element to another Set; if you try, what is
actuallly added is an ImmutableSet built from it (it compares equal to
the one you tried adding).

When you ask if `x in y' where x is a Set and y is a Set or
ImmutableSet, x is wrapped into a _TemporarilyImmutableSet z, and
what's tested is actually `z in y'.

# Code history:
#
# - Greg V. Wilson wrote the first version, using a different approach
#   to the mutable/immutable problem, and inheriting from dict.
#
# - Alex Martelli modified Greg's version to implement the current
#   Set/ImmutableSet approach, and make the data an attribute.
#
# - Guido van Rossum rewrote much of the code, made some API changes,
#   and cleaned up the docstrings.
