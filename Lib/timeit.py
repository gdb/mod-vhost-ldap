"""Framework for measuring execution time for small code snippets.

This module avoids a number of common traps for measuring execution
times.  See also Tim Peters' introduction to the Algorithms chapter in
the Python Cookbook, published by O'Reilly.

Library usage: see the Timer class.

Command line usage:
    python timeit.py [-n N] [-r N] [-s S] [-t] [-c] [-h] [statement]

Options:
  -n/--number N: how many times to execute 'statement' (default: see below)
  -r/--repeat N: how many times to repeat the timer (default 1)
  -s/--setup S: statements executed once before 'statement' (default 'pass')
  -t/--time: use time.time() (default on Unix)
  -c/--clock: use time.clock() (default on Windows)
  -h/--help: print this usage message and exit
  statement: statement to be timed (default 'pass')

A multi-line statement may be given by specifying each line as a
separate argument; indented lines are possible by enclosing an
argument in quotes and using leading spaces.

If -n is not given, a suitable number of loops is calculated by trying
successive powers of 10 until the total time is at least 0.2 seconds.

The difference in default timer function is because on Windows,
clock() has microsecond granularity but time()'s granularity is 1/60th
of a second; on Unix, clock() has 1/100th of a second granularity and
time() is much more precise.  On either platform, the default timer
functions measures wall clock time, not the CPU time.  This means that
other processes running on the same computer may interfere with the
timing.  The best thing to do when accurate timing is necessary is to
repeat the timing a few times and use the best time; the -r option is
good for this.  On Unix, you can use clock() to measure CPU time.

Note: there is a certain baseline overhead associated with executing a
pass statement.  The code here doesn't try to hide it, but you should
be aware of it (especially when comparing different versions of
Python).  The baseline overhead is measured by invoking the program
without arguments.

# To use this module with older versions of Python, the dependency on
# the itertools module is easily removed; in the template, instead of
# itertools.repeat(None, number), use [None]*number.  It's barely
# slower.  Note: the baseline overhead, measured by the default
# invocation, differs for older Python versions!  Also, to fairly
# compare older Python versions to Python 2.3, you may want to use
# python -O for the older versions to avoid timing SET_LINENO
# instructions.

# XXX Maybe for convenience of comparing with previous Python versions,
# itertools.repeat() should not be used at all?

        from the result vector and report these.  However, this is not
        very useful.  In a typical case, the lowest value gives a
        lower bound for how fast your machine can run the given code
        snippet; higher values in the result vector are typically not
        caused by variability in Python's speed, but by other
        processes interfering with your timing accuracy.  So the min()
        of the result is probably the only number you should be
        interested in.  After that, you should look at the entire
