    """Abstract base class to define the interface that must be implemented
       by real compiler abstraction classes.  Might have some use as a
       place for shared code, but it's not yet clear what code can be
       shared between compiler abstraction models for different platforms.

       The basic idea behind a compiler abstraction class is that each
       instance can be used for all the compile/link steps in building
       a single project.  Thus, attributes common to all of those compile
       and link steps -- include directories, macros to define, libraries
       to link against, etc. -- are attributes of the compiler instance.
       To allow for variability in how individual files are treated,
       most (all?) of those attributes may be varied on a per-compilation
       or per-link basis."""

    # 'compiler_type' is a class attribute that identifies this class.  It
    # keeps code that wants to know what kind of compiler it's dealing with
    # from having to import all possible compiler classes just to do an
    # 'isinstance'.  In concrete CCompiler subclasses, 'compiler_type'
    # should really, really be one of the keys of the 'compiler_class'
    # dictionary (see below -- used by the 'new_compiler()' factory
    # function) -- authors of new compiler interface classes are
    # responsible for updating 'compiler_class'!
    compiler_type = None

    # XXX things not handled by this compiler abstraction model:
    #   * client can't provide additional options for a compiler,
    #     e.g. warning, optimization, debugging flags.  Perhaps this
    #     should be the domain of concrete compiler abstraction classes
    #     (UnixCCompiler, MSVCCompiler, etc.) -- or perhaps the base
    #     class should have methods for the common ones.
    #   * can't put output files (object files, libraries, whatever)
    #     into a separate directory from their inputs.  Should this be
    #     handled by an 'output_dir' attribute of the whole object, or a
    #     parameter to the compile/link_* methods, or both?
    #   * can't completely override the include or library searchg
    #     path, ie. no "cc -I -Idir1 -Idir2" or "cc -L -Ldir1 -Ldir2".
    #     I'm not sure how widely supported this is even by Unix
    #     compilers, much less on other platforms.  And I'm even less
    #     sure how useful it is; maybe for cross-compiling, but
    #     support for that is a ways off.  (And anyways, cross
    #     compilers probably have a dedicated binary with the
    #     right paths compiled in.  I hope.)
    #   * can't do really freaky things with the library list/library
    #     dirs, e.g. "-Ldir1 -lfoo -Ldir2 -lfoo" to link against
    #     different versions of libfoo.a in different locations.  I
