"""distutils.unixccompiler

Contains the UnixCCompiler class, a subclass of CCompiler that handles
the "typical" Unix-style command-line C compiler:
  * macros defined with -Dname[=value]
  * macros undefined with -Uname
  * include search directories specified with -Idir
  * libraries specified with -lllib
  * library search directories specified with -Ldir
  * compile handled by 'cc' (or similar) executable with -c option:
    compiles .c to .o
  * link static library handled by 'ar' command (possibly with 'ranlib')
  * link shared library handled by 'cc -shared'

# XXX Things not currently handled:
#   * optimization/debug/warning flags; we just use whatever's in Python's
#     Makefile and live with it.  Is this adequate?  If not, we might
#     have to have a bunch of subclasses GNUCCompiler, SGICCompiler,
#     SunCCompiler, and I suspect down that road lies madness.
#   * even if we don't know a warning flag from an optimization flag,
#     we need some way for outsiders to feed preprocessor/compiler/linker
#     flags in to us -- eg. a sysadmin might want to mandate certain flags
#     via a site config file, or a user might want to set something for
#     compiling this module distribution only via the setup.py command
#     line, whatever.  As long as these options come from something on the
#     current system, they can be as system-dependent as they like, and we
#     should just happily stuff them into the preprocessor/compiler/linker
#     options and carry on.
