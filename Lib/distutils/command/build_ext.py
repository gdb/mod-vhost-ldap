    # XXX thoughts on how to deal with complex command-line options like
    # these, i.e. how to make it so fancy_getopt can suck them off the
    # command line and make it look like setup.py defined the appropriate
    # lists of tuples of what-have-you.
    #   - each command needs a callback to process its command-line options
    #   - Command.__init__() needs access to its share of the whole
    #     command line (must ultimately come from
    #     Distribution.parse_command_line())
    #   - it then calls the current command class' option-parsing
    #     callback to deal with weird options like -D, which have to
    #     parse the option text and churn out some custom data
    #     structure
    #   - that data structure (in this case, a list of 2-tuples)
    #     will then be present in the command object by the time
    #     we get to finalize_options() (i.e. the constructor
    #     takes care of both command-line and client options
    #     in between initialize_options() and finalize_options())
