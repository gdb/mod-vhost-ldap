"""distutils.command.build_lib

Implements the Distutils 'build_lib' command, to build a C/C++ library
that is included in the module distribution and needed by an extension
module."""

# XXX this module has *lots* of code ripped-off quite transparently from
# build_ext.py -- not surprisingly really, as the work required to build
# a static library from a collection of C source files is not really all
# that different from what's required to build a shared object file from
# a collection of C source files.  Nevertheless, I haven't done the
# necessary refactoring to account for the overlap in code between the
# two modules, mainly because a number of subtle details changed in the
# cut 'n paste.  Sigh.
