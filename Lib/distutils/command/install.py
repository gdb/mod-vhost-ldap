        # installation schemes for the Python library.  Issues that
        # are not yet resolved to my satisfaction:
        #   * how much platform dependence should be here, and
        #     how much can be pushed off to sysconfig (or, better, the
        #     Makefiles parsed by sysconfig)?
        #   * how independent of Python version should this be -- ie.
        #     should we have special cases to handle Python 1.5 and
        #     older, and then do it "the right way" for 1.6?  Or should
