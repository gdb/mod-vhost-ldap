       'setup' is really done within a Distribution instance, which
       farms the work out to the Distutils commands specified on the
       command line.

       Clients will almost never instantiate Distribution directly,
       unless the 'setup' function is totally inadequate to their needs.
       However, it is conceivable that a client might wish to subclass
       Distribution for some specialized purpose, and then pass the
       subclass to 'setup' as the 'distclass' keyword argument.  If so,
       it is necessary to respect the expectations that 'setup' has of

       'parse_command_line()' and 'run_commands()' with signatures like
