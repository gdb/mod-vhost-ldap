# Module 'posixpath' -- common operations on Posix pathnames.
# Some of this can actually be useful on non-Posix systems too, e.g.
# for manipulation of the pathname component of URLs.

# on other systems (e.g. Mac, Windows), os.path provides the same
# operations in a manner specific to that platform, and is an alias
# to another module (e.g. macpath, ntpath).
