/* BEWARE:

   Each interface exports both functions and macros. Extension modules
   should normally use the functions for ensuring binary compatibility
   of the user's code across Python versions. Subsequently, if the
   Python runtime switches to its own malloc (different from standard
   malloc), no recompilation is required for the extensions.

   The macro versions are free to trade compatibility for speed, although
   there's no guarantee they're ever faster.  Extensions shouldn't use the
   macro versions, as they don't gurantee binary compatibility across
   releases.

   Do not mix calls to PyMem_xyz with calls to platform
   malloc/realloc/calloc/free. */

/* Functions */

/* Functions supplying platform-independent semantics for malloc/realloc/
   free; useful if you need to be sure you're using the same memory
   allocator as Python (this can be especially important on Windows, if
   you need to make sure you're using the same MS malloc/free, and out of
   the same heap, as the main Python DLL uses).
   These functions make sure that allocating 0 bytes returns a distinct
   non-NULL pointer (whenever possible -- if we're flat out of memory, NULL
   may be returned), even if the platform malloc and realloc don't.
   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly.  No action is
   performed on failure (no exception is set, no warning is printed, etc).` */
