/**************************************************************************
Symbols and macros to supply platform-independent interfaces to basic
C language & library operations whose spellings vary across platforms.

Please try to make documentation here as clear as possible:  by definition,
the stuff here is trying to illuminate C's darkest corners.

Config #defines referenced here:

SIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT_ZERO_FILLS
Meaning:  To be defined iff i>>j does not extend the sign bit when i is a
          signed integral type and i < 0.
Used in:  Py_ARITHMETIC_RIGHT_SHIFT

RETSIGTYPE
Meaning:  Expands to void or int, depending on what the platform wants
          signal handlers to return.  Note that only void is ANSI!
Used in:  Py_RETURN_FROM_SIGNAL_HANDLER

/* Py_ARITHMETIC_RIGHT_SHIFT
 * C doesn't define whether a right-shift of a signed integer sign-extends
 * or zero-fills.  Here a macro to force sign extension:
 * Py_ARITHMETIC_RIGHT_SHIFT(TYPE, I, J)
 *    Return I >> J, forcing sign extension.
 * Requirements:
 *    I is of basic signed type TYPE (char, short, int, long, or long long).
 *    TYPE is one of char, short, int, long, or long long, although long long
 *    must not be used except on platforms that support it.
 *    J is an integer >= 0 and strictly less than the number of bits in TYPE
 *    (because C doesn't define what happens for J outside that range either).
 * Caution:
 *    I may be evaluated more than once.

 * "Simply" returns its argument.  However, macro expansions within the

/* Py_RETURN_FROM_SIGNAL_HANDLER
 * The return from a signal handler varies depending on whether RETSIGTYPE
 * is int or void.  The macro Py_RETURN_FROM_SIGNAL_HANDLER(VALUE) expands
 * to
 *     return VALUE
 * if RETSIGTYPE is int, else to nothing if RETSIGTYPE is void.
