/* An object allocator for Python.

   Here is an introduction to the layers of the Python memory architecture,
   showing where the object allocator is actually used (layer +2), It is
   called for every object allocation and deallocation (PyObject_New/Del),
   unless the object-specific allocators implement a proprietary allocation
   scheme (ex.: ints use a simple free list). This is also the place where
   the cyclic garbage collector operates selectively on container objects.

/*
 * Allocation strategy abstract:
 *
 * For small requests, the allocator sub-allocates <Big> blocks of memory.
 * Requests greater than 256 bytes are routed to the system's allocator.
 *
 * Small requests are grouped in size classes spaced 8 bytes apart, due
 * to the required valid alignment of the returned address. Requests of
 * a particular size are serviced from memory pools of 4K (one VMM page).
 * Pools are fragmented on demand and contain free lists of blocks of one
 * particular size class. In other words, there is a fixed-size allocator
 * for each size class. Free pools are shared by the different allocators
 * thus minimizing the space reserved for a particular size class.
 *
 * This allocation strategy is a variant of what is known as "simple
 * segregated storage based on array of free lists". The main drawback of
 * simple segregated storage is that we might end up with lot of reserved
 * memory for the different free lists, which degenerate in time. To avoid
 * this, we partition each free list in pools and we share dynamically the
 * reserved space between all free lists. This technique is quite efficient
 * for memory intensive programs which allocate mainly small-sized blocks.
 *
 * For small requests we have the following table:
 *
 * Request in bytes	Size of allocated block      Size class idx
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *        1-8                     8                       0

/*
 * Pool table -- headed, circular, doubly-linked lists of partially used pools.

This is involved.  For an index i, usedpools[i+i] is the header for a list of
all partially used pools holding small blocks with "size class idx" i. So
usedpools[0] corresponds to blocks of size 8, usedpools[2] to blocks of size
16, and so on:  index 2*i <-> blocks of size (i+1)<<ALIGNMENT_SHIFT.

The partially used pools for a given index are linked together via their
pool_header's prevpool and nextpool members.  "Partially used" means at least
one block in the pool is currently allocated, *and* at least one block in the
pool is not currently allocated.

When all blocks in a pool are allocated, the pool is unlinked from the list,
and isn't linked to from anything anymore (you can't find it then from
anything obmalloc.c knows about); the pool's own prevpool and nextpool
pointers are set to point to itself.  The comments say the pool "is full" then.

When a small block is returned to pymalloc, there are two cases.  If its pool
was full, its pool is relinked into the appropriate usedpools[] list, at the
front (so the next allocation of the same size class will be taken from this
pool).  Else its pool was not full, the pool is already in a usedpools[]
list, and isn't moved.  Instead the block is just linked to the front of the
pool's own freeblock singly-linked list.  However, if that makes the pool
entirely free of allocated blocks (the comments say the pool "is empty" then),
the pool is unlinked from usedpools[], and inserted at the front of the
(file static) singly-linked freepools list, via the pool header's nextpool
member; prevpool is meaningless in this case.  Pools put on the freepools
list can be changed to belong to a different size class.

Major obscurity:  While the usedpools vector is declared to have poolp
entries, it doesn't really.  It really contains two pointers per (conceptual)
poolp entry, the nextpool and prevpool members of a pool_header.  The
excruciating initialization code below fools C so that

    usedpool[i+i]

"acts like" a genuine poolp, but only so long as you only reference its
nextpool and prevpool members.  The "- 2*sizeof(block *)" gibberish is
compensating for that a pool_header's nextpool and prevpool members
immediately follow a pool_header's first two members:

	union { block *_padding;
		uint count; } ref;
	block *freeblock;

each of which consume sizeof(block *) bytes.  So what usedpools[i+i] really
contains is a fudged-up pointer p such that *if* C believes it's a poolp
pointer, then p->nextpool and p->prevpool are both p (meaning that the headed
circular list is empty).

It's unclear why the usedpools setup is so convoluted.  It could be to
minimize the amount of cache required to hold this heavily-referenced table
(which only *needs* the two interpool pointer members of a pool_header). OTOH,
referencing code has to remember to "double the index" and doing so isn't
free, usedpools[0] isn't a strictly legal pointer, and we're crucially relying
on that C doesn't insert any padding anywhere in a pool_header at or before
the prevpool member.

		 * free picks up "vanishes" during this resize, anything may
		 * happen, and it would be an incredibly rare bug.  Therefore
		 * the code here takes great pains to make sure that, at every
		 * moment, arenas always points to an intact vector of
		 * addresses.  It doesn't matter whether arenas points to a
		 * wholly up-to-date vector when pymalloc free checks it in

		 *
		 * In addition, without a lock we can't know for sure when
