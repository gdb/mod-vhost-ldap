Sorry, this list does not claim completeness.  If I fixed a bug
immediately upon receiving the first complaint I usually did not
nother to make an ehtry in this file, unless it was a serious bug
(core dump or infinite loop).

==> Status indicators: (-) not fixed; (?) fix proposed but not
    confirmed; (*) fixed.

======================================================================
BUGS found in 1.0.3
-------------------

(*) vars() error message is wrong (copied from dir() obviously).

(*) socket.gethostname() is undocumented.

(*) rfc822.py: getfirst* dies when multiple headers occur

(-) urllib caching is wrong (should use date from Expires header)

(*) On a related matter: regexpr.c still has two malloc()s the results
    of which are not tested for being NULL (lines 1253 and 1530). There
    are also some in rgbimagemodule.c. Am I overlooking something or is
    this a crasher?

(*) strop.rindex('abc', '') returns 0 instead of 3

(*) sunaudiodevmodule.o is too long!

(-) need newer DOS binary (16 bit version doesn't do default args)

(-) toplevel README needs new text on PC and Mac builds

(*) long(0x80000000) has wrong value!

======================================================================
Bugs found in 1.0.2 and not yet fixed
-------------------------------------

(-) compiler warnings about argument type of uname() on ULTRIX
machines

(-) syntax error for interactive input prints garbage instead of last
source line on some systems (e.g. AIX)

(?) (maybe) a bad .pyc file (with old magic number) causes the .py
file to be ignored

(-) Sunos4.0.2 / 386 configure bugs:
	- timelocal instead of mktime
	- unistd.h doesn't declare some functions

Bugs found in 1.0.2 and fixed in 1.0.3
--------------------------------------

(*) nasty bug in string formatting (see test_types.py, search for %)

(*) if a triple-quoted string ends in a quote followed by a newline
(followed immediately by the terminating 3 quotes) then a syntax error
or system error ensues

(*) bug in socket.listen: clipping backlog to >= 1 doesn't work

(*) two bogus XDEL's in Modules/regexmodule.reg_dealloc()

(*) Parser/myreadline.my_fgets: #endif EINTR misplaced

(*) new IP address for ftp.cwi.nl !!!

(*) typing vars() to interactive prompt runs into infinite loop
because of '_'

(*) tokenizer/tok_nextc() runs into infinite loop when file does not
end in linefeed

(*) Sunos4.0.2 / 386 configure bugs:
(*)	- use size_t at some places without including sys/types.h
(*)	- missing clock_t
(*)	- uses SEEK_SET in some places that don't include unistd.h

======================================================================
Bugs found in 1.0.1 and not yet fixed
-------------------------------------

(-) modsupport.c(vmkvalue): on systems where va_list is an array, the
calls to do_mkvalue and do_mktuple don't want an "&" before va.

(?) threads are slow on Solaris 2

(?) threads cause myreadline.c's readline() to think it sees an EOF.

(-) min() on PC version generates wrong result (i.e. same as max())
    [this happens on SoftPC -- don't know about other systems]

(-) flp.py cache bug: if the cache only contains one form, asking for
all forms returns only the cashed form

BUGS found in 1.0.0 and not yet fixed
-------------------------------------

(?) On NeXT, need to define _POSIX_SOURCE.

(?) there appears to be something wrong with gcc and -ldl on some
SunOS 4.1.3 systems

(-) jredfords reports core dump with float literals

BUGS found in 1.0.0 and fixed in 1.0.1
--------------------------------------

(*) On SGI IRIX 4 using cc, compilation errors in md5module.c.

(*) In cdmodule.c, getattr initialized with (destructor)!

(*) Lib/tzparse.py runs test() on import

(*) Lib/aifc.py, returns float rate, should be int

(*) Lib/sunau.py, incorrectly cumputes byte count from frame rate

(*) README should mention possibility of passing OPT=-g to make

(*) dynamic loading on sunos 4.1.3 must call dlopen(..., 1)

(*) use of <varargs.h> vs. <stdarg.h> should depend on
    HAVE_STDARG_PROTOTYPES, not on HAVE_STDARG_H

(*) once you interrupt time.sleep(), there is no interrupt handler!
