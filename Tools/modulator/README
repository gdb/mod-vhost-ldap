This is release 1.1 of modulator, a generator of boilerplate code for
modules to be written in C.

There is only one difference with release 1.0, really: the templates
now use "new-style" naming conventions. Many thanks to Chak Tan
<tan@ee.rochester.edu> for supplying them.

Usage when you have tk is *really* simple: start modulator, fill out
the forms specifying all the objects and methods, tell modulator
whether objects should also be accessible as sequences, etc and press
'generate code'. It will write a complete skeleton module for you.

Usage when you don't have tk is slightly more difficult. Look at
EXAMPLE.py for some details.

Oh yeah: you'll probably want to change Templates/copyright, or all
your code ends up as being copyrighted to CWI:-)

Let me know what you think,
