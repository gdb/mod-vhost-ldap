"""Switchboard class.

This class is used to coordinate updates among all Viewers.  Every Viewer must
conform to the following interface:

    - it must include a method called update_yourself() which takes three
      arguments; the red, green, and blue values of the selected color.

    - When a Viewer selects a color and wishes to update all other Views, it
      should call update_views() on the Switchboard object.  Not that the
      Viewer typically does *not* update itself before calling update_views(), 
      since this would cause it to get updated twice.
