"""Pynche: The PYthon Natural Color and Hue Editor.

Pynche is based largely on a similar color editor I wrote years ago for the
Sunview window system.  That editor was called ICE: the Interactive Color
Editor.  I'd always wanted to port the editor to X but didn't feel like
hacking X and C code to do it.  Fast forward many years, to where Python +
Tkinter + Pmw provides such a nice programming environment, with enough
power, that I finally buckled down and implemented it.  I changed the name
because these days, too many other systems have the acronym `ICE'.

This program currently requires Python 1.5 with Tkinter.  It also requires at
least Pmw 0.6.1.  It has only been tested on Solaris 2.6.  Feedback is greatly 
appreciated.  Send email to bwarsaw@python.org

Usage: %(PROGRAM)s [-c color] [-h]

Where:
    --color color
    -c color
        initial color, as an X color name or #RRGGBB format

    --help
    -h
        print this message
