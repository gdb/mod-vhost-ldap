"""Pynche: The PYthon Natural Color and Hue Editor.

Pynche is based largely on a similar color editor I wrote years ago for the
Sunview window system.  That editor was called ICE: the Interactive Color
Editor.  I'd always wanted to port the editor to X but didn't feel like
hacking X and C code to do it.  Fast forward many years, to where Python +
Tkinter + Pmw provides such a nice programming environment, with enough
power, that I finally buckled down and implemented it.  I changed the name
because these days, too many other systems have the acronym `ICE'.

Usage: %(PROGRAM) [-h]
