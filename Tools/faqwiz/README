FAQ Wizard
----------

Author: Guido van Rossum <guido@python.org>
Version: 0.4
Date: 26 May 1997


This is a CGI program that maintains a user-editable FAQ.  It uses RCS
to keep track of changes to individual FAQ entries.  It is fully
configurable; everything you might want to change when using this
program to maintain some other FAQ than the Python FAQ is contained in
the configuration module, faqconf.py.

Note that this is not an executable script; it's an importable module.
The actual script in cgi-bin minimal.

Files:

faqw.py		executable script to be edited and installed in cgi-bin
faqwin.py	main module, lives in same directory as FAQ entry files
faqconf.py	main configuration module
faqcust.py	additional local customization module (optional)
