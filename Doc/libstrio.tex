\section{Standard Module \sectcode{StringIO}}

\stmodindex{StringIO}

This module implements a file-like class, \code{StringIO},
that read and write a string buffer (also known as {\em memory
files}). See the description on file objects for operations.

When a \code{StringIO} object is created, it can be initialized
to an existing string by passing the string to the constructor.
If no string is given, the \code{StringIO} will start empty.

The method \code{getvalue()} can be called at any time to return the
contents of the entire ``file'' at any time.
