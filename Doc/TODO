PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================


* Document native package semantics.  (Where?  Guido?)

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current behavior;
  only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.

* Review libppath.tex for completeness, & system-specific behaviors.

* Clean up upgrade to LaTeX2HTML 98.1.  Most important: figure out a way to
  avoid image creation, & if necessary, make sure image creation at least
  doesn't fail.

* Separate modules which share a section.  (I think only one case remains.)
