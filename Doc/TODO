PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================


* Describe implementing types in C, including use of the 'self'
  parameter to the method implementation function.  (Missing material
  mentioned in the Extending & Embedding manual, section 1.1; problem
  reported by Clay Spence <cspence@sarnoff.com>.)

* Complete the "Matching vs. Searching" subsection in the re module
  section.

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current
  behavior; only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.

* Update the code module documentation.

* In the indexes, some subitem entries are separated from the item
  entries by column- or page-breaks.  Reported by Lorenzo M. Catucci
  <lorenzo@argon.roma2.infn.it>.  This one will be hard.

* Fix problem with howto documents getting the last module synopsis
  twice (in \localmoduletable) so we can get rid of the ugly 'uniq'
  hack in tools/mkhowto.sh.

* Figure out HTMLHelp generation for the Windows world.
