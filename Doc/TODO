PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================


* Document native package semantics.  (Where?  Guido?)

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current behavior;
  only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.

* Review libppath.tex for completeness, & system-specific behaviors.  (Why
  did this one get mentioned, specifically?)

* Separate modules which share a section.  (I think only one case remains.)

* In the indexes, some subitem entries are separated from the item entries
  by column- or page-breaks.  Reported by Lorenzo M. Catucci
  <lorenzo@argon.roma2.infn.it>.  This one will be hard.
