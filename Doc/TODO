PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================


* array module:  methods read(), reverse(), write() of the array object.

* Document native package semantics.

* Figure out indexsubitem handling in HTML; some of them are wrong for the
  items being indexed.

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current behavior;
  only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.

* Review libppath.tex for completeness, & system-specific behaviors.

* Figure out how to make the link borders in the PDF output go away
  completely.
