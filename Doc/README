This directory contains the LaTeX source to the Python documentation.
It is not all finished, but good enough to get you started.

The following are the LaTeX source files:

	tut.tex				The tutorial
	lib.tex, lib[1-5].tex		The library reference
	ref.tex				The reference manual
	qua.tex, quabib.bib		Article published in CWI Quarterly

All except qua.tex use the style option file "myformat.sty".  This
contains some simple macro definitions and sets style parameters.  You
can easily edit it to change the paper size (the default is European
paper, "A4" or 21 x 29.7 cm).

To format a document, run latex on it, twice, to get the forward
references right, then use dvips and lpr to print it, e.g.:

	latex lib
	latex lib
	dvips lib | lpr

Before calling dvips and lpr, you should really preview the dvi file,
e.g.

	xdvi lib

The qua document (which is not user documentation but a somewhat more
abstract review of Python and some work for which it was used) needs
a little more work:

	latex qua
	latex qua
	bibtex qua
	latex qua
	dvips qua | lpr
