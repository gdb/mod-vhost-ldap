This directory contains the source to the Python documentation.

Unfortunately it's not not very readable, complete or up-to-date yet --
in other words, I'm still working on it!

There are four documents and a macro file:

	macros.ms		macros .so'ed by the documents

	paper.ms		conference paper about Python
	intro.ms		informal introduction to Python
	ref.ms			Python language reference manual
	modules.ms		description of standard modules

XXX There should also be a man page.

To typeset one of the documents on the default Postscript printer, chdir
to this directory (otherwise the macros aren't found!) and issue the
command

	pstroff -ms file.ms

When typesetting all documents, issue a separate command for each.
