Python main documentation -- in LaTeX
-------------------------------------

This directory contains the LaTeX sources to the Python documentation
and a published article about Python.

The following are the LaTeX source files:

	tut.tex				The tutorial
	lib.tex, lib[1-5].tex		The library reference
	ref.tex				The reference manual
	qua.tex, quabib.bib		Article published in CWI Quarterly

All except qua.tex use the style option file "myformat.sty".  This
contains some macro definitions and sets some style parameters.

All documents are set up for European paper size ("A4": 21 x 29.7 cm)
by default.  To use US paper, remove the "a4wide" style option from
the \documentstyle options list in the first line of the main .tex
files (you may want to fiddle with the lay-out parameters, since the
default format uses rather wide margins to my taste).

You need the makeindex utility to produce the index for ref.tex
lib.tex; you need bibtex to produce the references list for qua.tex.

There's a Makefile to call latex and the other utilities in the right
order and the right number of times.  This will produce dvi files for
each document made; to preview them, use xdvi.  Printing depends on
local conventions; at my site, I use dvips and lpr.  For example:

	make ref			# creates ref.dvi
	xdvi ref			# preview it
	dvips -Ppsc ref | lpr -Ppsc	# print it on printer "psc".

If you don't have latex, you can ftp the pre-formatted PosytScript
versions of the documents; see "../misc/FTP" for information about
ftp-ing Python files.
