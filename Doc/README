This directory contains the LaTeX source to the Python documentation.
It is not all finished, but good enough to get you started.

The following are the LaTeX source files:

	tut.tex				The tutorial
	lib.tex, lib[1-5].tex		The library reference
	ref.tex				The reference manual
	qua.tex, quabib.bib		Article published in CWI Quarterly

All except qua.tex use the style option file "myformat.sty".  This
contains some macro definitions and sets style parameters.  You can
easily edit it to change the paper size (the default is European
paper, "A4": 21 x 29.7 cm).

There's a Makefile to call latex and other utilities (makeindex and
bibtex) in the right order and the right number of times.  This will
produce dvi files for each document made; to preview them, use xdvi.
Printing depends on local conventions; at my site, I use dvips and
lpr.  For example:

	make ref			# creates ref.dvi
	xdvi ref			# preview it
	dvips -Ppsc ref | lpr -Ppsc	# print it on printer "psc".
