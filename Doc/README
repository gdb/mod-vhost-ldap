Python main documentation -- in LaTeX
-------------------------------------

This directory contains the LaTeX sources to the Python documentation.
They now require LaTeX2e (LaTeX 2.09 compatibility is dropped).

If you don't have LaTeX, or if you'd rather not format the
documentation yourself, you can ftp a tar file containing HTML, PDF,
or PostScript versions of all documents.  Additional formats may be
available.  These should be in the same place where you fetched the
main Python distribution (try <http://www.python.org> or
<ftp://ftp.python.org>).

The following are the LaTeX source files:

	api/*.tex	Python/C API Reference Manual
	ext/*.tex	Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter
	lib/*.tex	Python Library Reference
	ref/*.tex	Python Reference Manual
	tut/*.tex	Python Tutorial

All use the "manual" document class and "python" package, derived from 
the old "myformat.sty" style file.  These contains many macro
definitions useful in documenting Python, and set some style parameters.

There's a Makefile to call LaTeX and the other utilities in the right
order and the right number of times.  This will produce DVI files for
each document made; to preview them, use xdvi.  PostScript is produced
by the same Makefile target that produces the DVI files.  This uses
the dvips tool.  Printing depends on local conventions; at our site,
we use lpr.  For example:

	make lib	# create lib.dvi and lib.ps
	xdvi lib	# preview lib.dvi
	lpr lib.ps	# print on default printer


What if I find a bug?
---------------------

First, check that the bug is present in the online version of the
documentation at <http://www.python.org/docs/>; we may have already
fixed it.

If we haven't, tell us about it.  We'd like the documentation to be
complete and accurate, but have limited time.  If you discover any
inconsistencies between the documentation and implementation, or just
have suggestions as to how to improve the documentation, let is know!
Send comments and patches to the Python Documentation Team:

			   python-docs@python.org

Thanks!


What tools do I need?
---------------------

You need to install Python; some of the scripts used to produce the
documentation are written in Python.

The simplest way to get the rest of the tools in the configuration we
used is to install the teTeX TeX distribution, version 0.4 or 0.9.  More
information is available on teTeX at <http://www.tug.org/tetex/>.
This is a UNIX-only TeX distribution at this time.  Note that the 0.9
release is still in testing; this documentation release was tested
with the 21 Apr 1998 release.  We'll be upgrading to the final version 
when it becomes available.  Except for the PDF generation, it also works
with the (stable) teTeX 0.4 release.

If you don't want to get teTeX, here is what you'll need:

To create DVI, PDF, or PostScript files:

	- LaTeX2e, 1995/12/01 or newer.  Older versions are likely to 
	  choke.

	- makeindex.  This is used to produce the indexes for the
	  library reference and Python/C API reference.

To create PDF files:

	- pdflatex.  We used the one in the teTeX 0.9 distribution
	  (version 0.12h at the time of this writing).  Versions even
	  a couple of patchlevels earlier are highly likely to fail
	  due to syntax changes for some of the pdftex primitives.

To create PostScript files:

	- dvips.  Most TeX installations include this.  If you don't
	  have one, check CTAN (<ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/>).

To create info files:

	(Note that info is not currently supported.  If you need it,
	please fix or replace tools/partparse.py and send the new
	version to python-docs@python.org.  We'll be glad to provide
	free copies of the info files to anyone who can support the
	process.  ;-)

	- makeinfo.  This is available from any GNU mirror.

	- emacs or xemacs.  Emacs is available from the same place as
	  makeinfo, and xemacs is available from ftp.xemacs.org.

To create HTML files:

	- Perl 5.004_04 or newer.  Find the software at
	  <http://language.perl.com/info/software.html>.

	- LaTeX2HTML 98.1p1, or newer.  Releases are available at
	  <http://www-dsed.llnl.gov/files/programs/unix/latex2html/>.


What if Times fonts are not available?
--------------------------------------

As distributed, the LaTeX documents use PostScript Times fonts.  This
is done since they are much better looking and produce smaller
PostScript files.  If, however, your TeX installation does not support 
them, they may be easily disabled.  Edit the file
texiinputs/manual.cls and comment out the line that starts
"\RequirePackage{times}" using a "%" character at the beginning of the
line.  An alternative is to install the right fonts and LaTeX style
file.


What if I want to use A4 paper?
-------------------------------

Instead of building the PostScript by giving the command "make", give
the command "make PAPER=a4"; the output will be produced in the
paper-a4/ subdirectory.


Making HTML files
-----------------

The LaTeX documents can be converted to HTML using Nikos Drakos'
LaTeX2HTML converter.  See the Makefile; after some twiddling, "make
l2h" should do the trick.


What else is in here?
---------------------

There is a new LaTeX document class called "howto".  This is used for
the new series of Python HOWTO documents which is being coordinated by 
Andrew Kuchling <amk@acm.org>.  The file howto.tex is a commented
example which may be used a template.  A script to "do the right
thing" to format a howto document is included as tools/mkhowto.sh.
Support for this document class is still new, but is expected to
evolve rapidly.  Use "mkhowto.sh --help" for information on using the
formatting tool.
