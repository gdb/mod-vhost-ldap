\section{Built-in Module \sectcode{thread}}
\bimodindex{thread}

This module provides low-level primitives for working with multiple
threads (a.k.a. \dfn{light-weight processes} or \dfn{tasks}) --- multiple
threads of control sharing their global data space.  For
synchronization, simple locks (a.k.a. \dfn{mutexes} or \dfn{binary
semaphores}) are provided.

The module is optional and supported on SGI and Sun Sparc systems only.

It defines the following constant and functions:

\renewcommand{\indexsubitem}{(in module thread)}
\begin{excdesc}{error}
Raised on thread-specific errors.
\end{excdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{start_new_thread}{func\, arg}
Start a new thread.  The thread executes the function \var{func}
with the argument list \var{arg} (which must be a tuple).  When the
function returns, the thread silently exits.  When the function raises
terminates with an unhandled exception, a stack trace is printed and
then the thread exits (but other threads continue to run).
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{exit_thread}{}
Exit the current thread silently.  Other threads continue to run.
\strong{Caveat:} code in pending \code{finally} clauses is not executed.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{exit_prog}{status}
Exit all threads and report the value of the integer argument
\var{status} as the exit status of the entire program.
\strong{Caveat:} code in pending \code{finally} clauses, in this thread
or in other threads, is not executed.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{allocate_lock}{}
Return a new lock object.  Methods of locks are described below.  The
lock is initially unlocked.
\end{funcdesc}

Lock objects have the following methods:

\renewcommand{\indexsubitem}{(lock method)}
\begin{funcdesc}{acquire}{waitflag}
Without the optional argument, this method acquires the lock
unconditionally, if necessary waiting until it is released by another
thread (only one thread at a time can acquire a lock --- that's their
reason for existence), and returns \code{None}.  If the integer
\var{waitflag} argument is present, the action depends on its value:
if it is zero, the lock is only acquired if it can be acquired
immediately without waiting, while if it is nonzero, the lock is
acquired unconditionally as before.  If an argument is present, the
return value is 1 if the lock is acquired successfully, 0 if not.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{release}{}
Releases the lock.  The lock must have been acquired earlier, but not
necessarily by the same thread.
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{locked}{}
Return the status of the lock: 1 if it has been acquired by some
thread, 0 if not.
\end{funcdesc}

{\bf Caveats:}

\begin{itemize}
\item
Threads interact strangely with interrupts: the
\code{KeyboardInterrupt} exception will be received by an arbitrary
thread.

\item
Calling \code{sys.exit(\var{status})} or executing
\code{raise SystemExit, \var{status}} is almost equivalent to calling
\code{thread.exit_prog(\var{status})}, except that the former ways of
exiting the entire program do honor \code{finally} clauses in the
current thread (but not in other threads).

\item
Not all built-in functions that may block waiting for I/O allow other
threads to run, although the most popular ones (\code{sleep},
\code{read}, \code{select}) work as expected.

\end{itemize}
