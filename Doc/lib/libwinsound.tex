\versionadded{1.5.2}

The \module{winsound} module provides access to the basic
sound-playing machinery provided by Windows platforms.  It includes a
single function and several constants.


\begin{funcdesc}{PlaySound}{sound, flags}
  Call the underlying \cfunction{PlaySound()} function from the
  Platform API.  The \var{sound} parameter may be a filename, audio
  data as a string, or \code{None}.  Its interpretation depends on the
  value of \var{flags}, which can be a bit-wise ORed combination of
  the constants described below.  If the system indicates an error,
  \exception{RuntimeError} is raised.
\end{funcdesc}


\begin{datadesc}{SND_FILENAME}
  The \var{sound} parameter is the name of a WAV file.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_ALIAS}
  The \var{sound} parameter should be interpreted as a control panel
  sound association name.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_LOOP}
  Play the sound repeatedly.  The \constant{SND_ASYNC} flag must also
  be used to avoid blocking.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_MEMORY}
  The \var{sound} parameter to \function{PlaySound()} is a memory
  image of a WAV file.

  \strong{Note:}  This module does not support playing from a memory
  image asynchonously, so a combination of this flag and
  \constant{SND_ASYNC} will raise a \exception{RuntimeError}.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_PURGE}
  Stop playing all instances of the specified sound.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_ASYNC}
  Return immediately, allowing sounds to play asynchronously.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_NODEFAULT}
  If the specified sound cannot be found, do not play a default beep.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_NOSTOP}
  Do not interrupt sounds currently playing.
\end{datadesc}

\begin{datadesc}{SND_NOWAIT}
  Return immediately if the sound driver is busy.
\end{datadesc}
