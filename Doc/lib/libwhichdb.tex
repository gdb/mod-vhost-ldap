\section{Standard Module \module{whichdb}}
\label{module-whichdb}
\stmodindex{whichdb}

The single function in this module attempts to guess which of the
several simple database modules available--dbm, gdbm, or
dbhash--should be used to open a given file.

\begin{funcdesc}{whichdb}{filename}
Returns one of the following values: \code{None} if the file can't be
opened because it's unreadable or doesn't exist; the empty string
(\code{""}) if the file's format can't be guessed; or a string
containing the required module name, such as \code{"dbm"} or
\code{"gdbm"}.
\end{funcdesc}
