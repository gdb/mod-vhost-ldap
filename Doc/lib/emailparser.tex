\modulesynopsis{Parse flat text email messages to produce a message
	        object structure.}

Message object structures can be created in one of two ways: they can be
created from whole cloth by instantiating \class{Message} objects and
stringing them together via \method{attach()} and
\method{set_payload()} calls, or they can be created by parsing a flat text
representation of the email message.

The \module{email} package provides a standard parser that understands
most email document structures, including MIME documents.  You can
pass the parser a string or a file object, and the parser will return
to you the root \class{Message} instance of the object structure.  For
simple, non-MIME messages the payload of this root object will likely
be a string containing the text of the message.  For MIME
messages, the root object will return \code{True} from its
\method{is_multipart()} method, and the subparts can be accessed via
the \method{get_payload()} and \method{walk()} methods.

Note that the parser can be extended in limited ways, and of course
you can implement your own parser completely from scratch.  There is
no magical connection between the \module{email} package's bundled
parser and the \class{Message} class, so your custom parser can create
message object trees any way it finds necessary.

The primary parser class is \class{Parser} which parses both the
headers and the payload of the message.  In the case of
\mimetype{multipart} messages, it will recursively parse the body of
the container message.  Two modes of parsing are supported,
\emph{strict} parsing, which will usually reject any non-RFC compliant
message, and \emph{lax} parsing, which attempts to adjust for common
MIME formatting problems.

The \module{email.Parser} module also provides a second class, called
\class{HeaderParser} which can be used if you're only interested in
the headers of the message. \class{HeaderParser} can be much faster in
these situations, since it does not attempt to parse the message body,
instead setting the payload to the raw body as a string.
\class{HeaderParser} has the same API as the \class{Parser} class.

\subsubsection{Parser class API}

\begin{classdesc}{Parser}{\optional{_class\optional{, strict}}}
The constructor for the \class{Parser} class takes an optional
argument \var{_class}.  This must be a callable factory (such as a
function or a class), and it is used whenever a sub-message object
needs to be created.  It defaults to \class{Message} (see
\refmodule{email.Message}).  The factory will be called without
arguments.

The optional \var{strict} flag specifies whether strict or lax parsing
should be performed.  Normally, when things like MIME terminating
boundaries are missing, or when messages contain other formatting
problems, the \class{Parser} will raise a
\exception{MessageParseError}.  However, when lax parsing is enabled,
the \class{Parser} will attempt to work around such broken formatting
to produce a usable message structure (this doesn't mean
\exception{MessageParseError}s are never raised; some ill-formatted
messages just can't be parsed).  The \var{strict} flag defaults to
\code{False} since lax parsing usually provides the most convenient
behavior.

\versionchanged[The \var{strict} flag was added]{2.2.2}
\end{classdesc}

The other public \class{Parser} methods are:

\begin{methoddesc}[Parser]{parse}{fp\optional{, headersonly}}
Read all the data from the file-like object \var{fp}, parse the
resulting text, and return the root message object.  \var{fp} must
support both the \method{readline()} and the \method{read()} methods
on file-like objects.

The text contained in \var{fp} must be formatted as a block of \rfc{2822}
style headers and header continuation lines, optionally preceded by a
envelope header.  The header block is terminated either by the
end of the data or by a blank line.  Following the header block is the
body of the message (which may contain MIME-encoded subparts).

Optional \var{headersonly} is as with the \method{parse()} method.

\versionchanged[The \var{headersonly} flag was added]{2.2.2}
\end{methoddesc}

\begin{methoddesc}[Parser]{parsestr}{text\optional{, headersonly}}
Similar to the \method{parse()} method, except it takes a string
object instead of a file-like object.  Calling this method on a string
is exactly equivalent to wrapping \var{text} in a \class{StringIO}
instance first and calling \method{parse()}.

Optional \var{headersonly} is a flag specifying whether to stop
parsing after reading the headers or not.  The default is \code{False},
meaning it parses the entire contents of the file.

\versionchanged[The \var{headersonly} flag was added]{2.2.2}
\end{methoddesc}

Since creating a message object structure from a string or a file
object is such a common task, two functions are provided as a
convenience.  They are available in the top-level \module{email}
package namespace.

\begin{funcdesc}{message_from_string}{s\optional{, _class\optional{, strict}}}
Return a message object structure from a string.  This is exactly
equivalent to \code{Parser().parsestr(s)}.  Optional \var{_class} and
\var{strict} are interpreted as with the \class{Parser} class constructor.

\versionchanged[The \var{strict} flag was added]{2.2.2}
\end{funcdesc}

\begin{funcdesc}{message_from_file}{fp\optional{, _class\optional{, strict}}}
Return a message object structure tree from an open file object.  This
is exactly equivalent to \code{Parser().parse(fp)}.  Optional
\var{_class} and \var{strict} are interpreted as with the
\class{Parser} class constructor.

\versionchanged[The \var{strict} flag was added]{2.2.2}
\end{funcdesc}

Here's an example of how you might use this at an interactive Python
prompt:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import email
>>> msg = email.message_from_string(myString)
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Additional notes}

Here are some notes on the parsing semantics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Most non-\mimetype{multipart} type messages are parsed as a single
      message object with a string payload.  These objects will return
      \code{False} for \method{is_multipart()}.  Their
      \method{get_payload()} method will return a string object.
\item All \mimetype{multipart} type messages will be parsed as a
      container message object with a list of sub-message objects for
      their payload.  The outer container message will return
      \code{True} for \method{is_multipart()} and their
      \method{get_payload()} method will return the list of
      \class{Message} subparts.
\item Most messages with a content type of \mimetype{message/*}
      (e.g. \mimetype{message/deliver-status} and
      \mimetype{message/rfc822}) will also be parsed as container
      object containing a list payload of length 1.  Their
      \method{is_multipart()} method will return \code{True}.  The
      single element in the list payload will be a sub-message object.
\end{itemize}
