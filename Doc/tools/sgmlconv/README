These scripts and Makefile fragment are used to convert the Python
documentation in LaTeX format to SGML or XML.  Though I originally
thought that the XML was unlikely to be used, tool support for XML
is increasing quickly enough that it may well be the final format.
(It is the default output format when using the makefiles included
here.)

This material is preliminary and incomplete.  The XML omnibus package
developed by the Python XML-SIG is required; specifically, the version
available in the public CVS repository.  See
http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/ for more information on the
package.

To convert all documents to SGML:

	cd Doc/
	make -f tools/sgmlconv/Makefile sgml

To convert a document to SGML:

	cd Doc/<document-dir>
	make -f ../tools/sgmlconv/make.rules TOOLSDIR=../tools

To generate XML instead, use:

	cd Doc/<document-dir>
	make -f ../tools/sgmlconv/make.rules TOOLSDIR=../tools xml

Note that building the second target format is fast because both
conversions use the same intermediate format (an ESIS event stream).
This is true regardless of whether you build SGML or XML first.
