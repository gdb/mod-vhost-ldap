These scripts and Makefile fragment are used to convert the Python
documentation in LaTeX format to SGML.  XML is also supported as a
target, but is unlikely to be used.

This material is highly preliminary and incomplete.  The XML omnibus
package developed by the Python XML-SIG is required.  See
http://www.python.org/sigs/xml-sig/ for more information on the
package.

To convert a document to SGML:

	cd Doc/<document-dir>
	make -f ../tools/sgmlconv/make.rules TOOLSDIR=../tools

To generate XML instead, use:

	cd Doc/<document-dir>
	make -f ../tools/sgmlconv/make.rules TOOLSDIR=../tools xml

Note that building the second target format is fast because both
conversions use the same intermediate format (an ESIS event stream).

Please send comments and bug reports to python-docs@python.org.
