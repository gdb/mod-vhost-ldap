<p>To download an archive containing all the documents for this version of
Python in one of various formats, follow one of links in this table. The numbers
in the table are the size of the download files in Kilobytes.</p>

{# XXX download links #}


<p>These archives contain all the content in the documentation section.</p>

<h2>Unpacking</h2>

<p>Unix users should download the .tar.bz2 archives; these are bzipped tar
archives and can be handled in the usual way using tar and the bzip2
program. The <a href="http://www.info-zip.org">InfoZIP</a> unzip program can be
used to handle the ZIP archives if desired. The .tar.bz2 archives provide the
best compression and fastest download times.</p>

<p>Windows users can use the ZIP archives since those are customary on that
platform. These are created on Unix using the InfoZIP zip program. They may be
unpacked using the free WiZ tool (from the InfoZIP developers) or any other
tool for handling ZIP archives; any of them should work.</p>

<p>Note that the .tar.bz2 files are smaller than the other archives; Windows
users may want to install the bzip2 tools on their systems as well. Windows
binaries for a command-line tool are available at <a
href="http://www.bzip.org">The bzip2 and libbzip2 official home page</a>, but
most other archiving utilities support the tar and bzip2 formats as well.</p>


<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><strong>Printing PDFs using Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.0:</strong> Adobe has
reportedly admitted that there is a bug in Acrobat Reader 5.0 which causes it
not to print at least some PDF files generated by pdfTeX. This software is used
to produce the PDF version of the Python documentation, and our documents
definately trigger this bug in Acrobat Reader. To print the PDF files, use
Acrobat Reader 4.x, ghostscript, or xpdf.</p>

<p>Reportedly, Acrobat Reader 6.0 can print these documents without this
problem, but we've not yet had an opportunity to confirm the report. Sadly,
version 6.0 is not yet available on Unix platforms.</p>

<p>If you have comments or suggestions for the Python documentation, please send
email to <a href="docs@python.org">docs@python.org</a>.</p>
