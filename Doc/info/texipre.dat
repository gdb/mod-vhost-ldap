This file describes the built-in types, exceptions and functions and the
standard modules that come with the Python system.  It assumes basic
knowledge about the Python language.  For an informal introduction to
the language, see the Python Tutorial.  The Python Reference Manual
gives a more formal definition of the language.  (These manuals are not
available in INFO or Texinfo format.)
