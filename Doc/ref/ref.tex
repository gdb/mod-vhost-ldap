\begin{abstract}

\noindent
Python is a simple, yet powerful, interpreted programming language
that bridges the gap between C and shell programming, and is thus
ideally suited for ``throw-away programming'' and rapid prototyping.
Its syntax is put together from constructs borrowed from a variety of
other languages; most prominent are influences from ABC, C, Modula-3
and Icon.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data
types implemented in C.  Python is also suitable as an extension
language for highly customizable C applications such as editors or
window managers.

Python is available for various operating systems, amongst which
several flavors of {\UNIX} (including Linux), the Apple Macintosh O.S.,
MS-DOS, MS-Windows 3.1, Windows NT, and OS/2.

This reference manual describes the syntax and ``core semantics'' of
the language.  It is terse, but attempts to be exact and complete.
The semantics of non-essential built-in object types and of the
built-in functions and modules are described in the {\em Python
Library Reference}.  For an informal introduction to the language, see
the {\em Python Tutorial}.
