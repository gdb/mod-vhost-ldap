\chapter{Built-in Types, Exceptions and Functions}

\nodename{Built-in Objects}

Names for built-in exceptions and functions are found in a separate
symbol table.  This table is searched last, so local and global
user-defined names can override built-in names.  Built-in types have
no names but are created easily by constructing an object of the
desired type (e.g., using a literal) and applying the built-in
function \code{type()} to it.  They are described together here for
easy reference.%
\footnote{Some descriptions sorely lack explanations of the exceptions
	that may be raised --- this will be fixed in a future version of
	this document.}
