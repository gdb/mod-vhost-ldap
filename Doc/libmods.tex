\chapter{Built-in Modules}

The modules described in this chapter are built into the interpreter
and considered part of Python's standard environment: they are always
avaialble.\footnote{at least in theory --- it is possible to specify
at build time that one or more of these modules should be excluded,
but it would be antisocial to do so.}
