Mon Jan  3 00:02:24 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* configure.in: added AC_REVISION call to top

	* Modules/flmodule.c (form_setattr): one NULL should be 0

	* Include/myselect.h: this now implies mytime.h and attempts to
	work around systems where sys/select.h and sys/time.h can't be
	included together

	* Modules/socketmodule.c, Doc/libsocket.tex: remove socket avail()
	method -- you can use select instead

	* Modules/Setup: disable dbm, it is not truly portable

	* Lib/sunau.py: incorporate one-line fix by Sjoerd

	* Include/pgenheaders.h: include <stdlib.h> if its symbol
	defined, not just on the mac

	* Include/grammar.h: remove redundant structure tags

	* Include/cgensupport.h: avoid possible macro argument
	substitution inside string literal

	* configure.in, Include/config.h.in: add test whether sys/select.h
	and sys/times.h can be included by the same program

	* Include/config.h.in: add lines for HAVE_SYS_UN_H and
	HAVE_GETPEERNAME

	* Extensions/mkext.py: copy change in library order from
	Modules/Makefile.in.in

	* Modules/Makefile.in.in: change library order subtly so -ltermcap
	follows instead of precedes -lgl_s on SGI systems; this solves
	(hides?) problems with clashing entry points

	* configure.in: added sys/un.h to list of tested header files;
	added getpeername to list of tested functions (both for
	Modules/socketmodule.c)

	* Modules/socketmodule.c: conditionally include sys/un.h and
	change tests for AF_UNIX to tests for HAVE_SYS_UN_H; test for
	HAVE_GETPEERNAME instead of NO_PEERNAME

	* Modules/config.c.in: add marshal and __main__ built-in modules

	* Python/sysmodule.c (list_builtin_module_names): sort the list

	* Doc/Makefile: remove 'qua' from default targets

	* Doc/README: add reference to ext.tex, change reference to
	lib*.tex, explain that qua isn't built by default

	* README: explain DESTDIR, clarify install procedure, add more
	explanation to some options, add description of ChangeLog, add
	wuarchive.wustl.edu to list of mirror sites

	* Modules/socketmodule.c: make AF_UNIX code dependent on existence
	of AF_UNIX (SCO ODT 3.0 doesn't support it -- let's hope it
	doesn't define the symbol either)

	* Makefile: attempt to fix install targets (added separate
	libinstall and maninstall)

	* Doc/libregex.tex: documented Tracy Tims' changes

	* Modules/regexpr.c: redid Tracy Tims' changes to minimize diffs
	(only two added lines now)

	* Modules/regexmodule.c: fix core dump when asking a plain regex
	object for a named group

Sun Jan  2 23:10:44 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* README, Python/version.c: changed version string to 1.0.0 BETA 2

	* Modules/{regexpr.{c,h},regexmodule.c}: merged in Tracy Tims'
	mods for named subexpressions

	* Include/regexpr.h: moved to Modules/regexpr.h

	* Modules/timingmodule.c: change tests for no arguments

	* configure.in: remove strtoul from AC_REPLACE_FUNCS; remove
	initial blank line (which got copied into configure so it wouldn't
	start with #!/bin/sh as required)

	* Python/compile.c: call mystrto(u)l instrad of strto(u)l

	* Python/Makefile.in: add mystrtoul.c to OBJS

	* Python/mystrtoul.c: renamed from strtol.c; renamed functions to
	mystrto(u)l; this is now a standard source file (since some
	systems have a strto(u)l that doesn't report errors properly)

	* Modules/Setup: added entry for timing module

	* Modules/{timing.h,timingmodule.c}: new files implementing GNN's
	timing module
