Mon Jan  3 00:02:24 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* Doc/Makefile: remove 'qua' from default targets

	* Doc/README: add reference to ext.tex, change reference to
	lib*.tex, explain that qua isn't built by default

	* README: explain DESTDIR, clarify install procedure, add more
	explanation to some options, add description of ChangeLog, add
	wuarchive.wustl.edu to list of mirror sites

	* Modules/socketmodule.c: make AF_UNIX code dependent on existence
	of AF_UNIX (SCO ODT 3.0 doesn't support it -- let's hope it
	doesn't define the symbol either)

	* Makefile: attempt to fix install targets (added separate
	libinstall and maninstall)

	* Doc/libregex.tex: documented Tracy Tims' changes

	* Modules/regexpr.c: redid Tracy Tims' changes to minimize diffs
	(only two added lines now)

	* Modules/regexmodule.c: fix core dump when asking a plain regex
	object for a named group

Sun Jan  2 23:10:44 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* README, Python/version.c: changed version string to 1.0.0 BETA 2

	* Modules/{regexpr.{c,h},regexmodule.c}: merged in Tracy Tims'
	mods for named subexpressions

	* Include/regexpr.h: moved to Modules/regexpr.h

	* Modules/timingmodule.c: change tests for no arguments

	* configure.in: remove strtoul from AC_REPLACE_FUNCS; remove
	initial blank line (which got copied into configure so it wouldn't
	start with #!/bin/sh as required)

	* Python/compile.c: call mystrto(u)l instrad of strto(u)l

	* Python/Makefile.in: add mystrtoul.c to OBJS

	* Python/mystrtoul.c: renamed from strtol.c; renamed functions to
	mystrto(u)l; this is now a standard source file (since some
	systems have a strto(u)l that doesn't report errors properly)

	* Modules/Setup: added entry for timing module

	* Modules/{timing.h,timingmodule.c}: new files implementing GNN's
	timing module
