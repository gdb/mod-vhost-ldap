Wed Jan 12 10:17:41 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* Many modules and objects: use 'staticforward' where needed

	* Include/object.h: added #define 'staticforward' as either static
	or extern depending on BAD_STATIC_FORWARD

	* acconfig.h: added BAD_STATIC_FORWARD

	* configure.in: added test for bad static forward

Mon Jan 10 10:35:21 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* Modules/md5module.c: SCO ODT 3.0 dependent fix

	* Objects/xxobject.c: quote size fields as tp_basicsize instead of
	(incorrectly) tp_size

	* Objects/listobject.c (cmp): arguments must be const!!!

	warnings about changed semantics in ANSI C

	* configure.in: added --with-libc=... and --with-libm=...

	* Modules/Makefile.pre.in: Remove dependency of Setup on Setup.in,
	so it is only copied when Setup does not exist at all; add
	prefix=/usr/local so Setup can base default path on --prefix
	option to toplevel configure script

	* Modules/Setup.in: clarified build procedure in comments; don't
	include GNN's timing module by default; use $(prefix) instead
	requiring manual edit of DESTDIR

	* Makefile.in: replace DESTDIR by prefix and exec_prefix and
	updated affected targets; added inclinstall and libainstall
	targets

	* Objects/accessobject.c: removed (???) from comment to avoid

	* Modules/rgbimgmodule.c: Only include <unistd.h> if it exists

	* Modules/timemodule.c: don't include sys/time.h on the Mac

	* Parser/intrcheck.c: Make sure <MacHeaders> is included before
	any other include file

	* Modules/audioopmodule.c: include math.h after allobjects.h (so
	the latter can be a precompiled header file on the Mac)

Wed Jan  5 15:34:26 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@poseidon.cwi.nl)

	* Python/pythonrun.c (sighandler): only call kill(getpid()) if
	getpid() exists; otherwise call exit(1)

========================================================================
Release of 1.0.0 BETA 4 (Jan 5 1994)

========================================================================
Release of 1.0.0 BETA 3 (Jan 5 1994)
========================================================================

Wed Jan  5 00:18:45 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* {Parser,Objects,Python,Makefile}/Makefile*in: made depend target
	work with VPATH

	* README: describe new build procedure; added section on building
	for multiple architectures

	* acconfig.h: fix (reversed!) comment for SYS_SELECT_WITH_SYS_TIME

	* Modules/Makefile.pre.in: copy Setup from $(srcdir) if not
	present, and use local Setup as input for makesetup script

Tue Jan  4 12:32:16 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	* Note that there are no functional changes below -- just changes
	to the build process and changes to avoid compiler warnings

	* Modules/Setup: disable nis as well by default, change the
	pertaining comments, and change the comments about the multimedia
	modules to be default on

	* fixed all warnings about function pointer initializations, and
	miscellanous other warnings (e.g. about extern forward references
	to static variables); touched random bits of code as a consequence

	* changed configuration process and Makefiles to support VPATH;
	for this, config.h(.in) now lives to the toplevel directory, the
	toplevel Makefile is now created by configure as well, and various
	improvements to it have been made (e.g. working tags and TAGS
	targets), the makesetup script follows configure instead of
	preceding it, it understands srcdir and has an exception for
	glmodule.c, the intermediate file is called Makefile.pre, the
	Makefiles don't use TOP any more and are much more careful about
	the difference between .. and the toplevel directory, and I've
	improved my understanding of how configure handles srcdir

	* Modules/threadmodule.c: refuse to compile when WITH_THREAD is not
	defined

	* configure.in, acconfig.h, config.h.in, Include/ceval.h,
	Modules/{stdwin,thread}module.c, Python/{ceval,pythonrun}.c:
	renamed USE_THREAD to WITH_THREAD

	* configure.in: add AC_PROG_INSTALL

	* README, Python/version.c: version set to 1.0.0 BETA 3

	* Demo, Include, Lib: added Makefile with clean/clobber targets

	* README: added remarks on --with-svr4; unnumber special cases

	* configure.in: only look for -lnsl and -lsocket if --with-svr4 is
	specified, to avoid linking with them on IRIX 5

========================================================================
Release of 1.0.0 BETA 2 (Jan 3 1994)
========================================================================

Mon Jan  3 22:21:24 1994  Guido van Rossum  (guido@voorn.cwi.nl)

	similar things

	* Modules/rotormodule.c (RTR_e_char, RTR_d_char): avoid warnings
	by picky compilers about unsigned % signed

	* README: added a section on building it for non-UNIX systems

	* Makefile (configure): call autoheader when calling autoconf

	* Include/config.h.in: now generated by autoheader

	* acconfig.h: new file (input for autoheader)

	* configure.in: added AC_REVISION call to top

	* Modules/flmodule.c (form_setattr): one NULL should be 0

	* Include/myselect.h: this now implies mytime.h and attempts to
	work around systems where sys/select.h and sys/time.h can't be
	included together

	* Modules/socketmodule.c, Doc/libsocket.tex: remove socket avail()
	method -- you can use select instead

	* Modules/Setup: disable dbm, it is not truly portable

	* Lib/sunau.py: incorporate one-line fix by Sjoerd

	* Include/pgenheaders.h: include <stdlib.h> if its symbol
	defined, not just on the mac

	* Include/grammar.h: remove redundant structure tags

	* Include/cgensupport.h: avoid possible macro argument
	substitution inside string literal

	* configure.in, Include/config.h.in: add test whether sys/select.h
	and sys/times.h can be included by the same program

	* Include/config.h.in: add lines for HAVE_SYS_UN_H and
	HAVE_GETPEERNAME

	* Extensions/mkext.py: copy change in library order from
	Modules/Makefile.in.in

	* Modules/Makefile.in.in: change library order subtly so -ltermcap
	follows instead of precedes -lgl_s on SGI systems; this solves
	(hides?) problems with clashing entry points

	* configure.in: added sys/un.h to list of tested header files;
	added getpeername to list of tested functions (both for
	Modules/socketmodule.c)

	* Modules/socketmodule.c: conditionally include sys/un.h and
	change tests for AF_UNIX to tests for HAVE_SYS_UN_H; test for
	HAVE_GETPEERNAME instead of NO_PEERNAME

	* Modules/config.c.in: add marshal and __main__ built-in modules

	* Python/sysmodule.c (list_builtin_module_names): sort the list

	explanation to some options, add description of ChangeLog, add
	wuarchive.wustl.edu to list of mirror sites

	* Modules/socketmodule.c: make AF_UNIX code dependent on existence
	of AF_UNIX (SCO ODT 3.0 doesn't support it -- let's hope it
	doesn't define the symbol either)

	* Makefile: attempt to fix install targets (added separate
	libinstall and maninstall)

	* Doc/libregex.tex: documented Tracy Tims' changes

	* Modules/regexpr.c: redid Tracy Tims' changes to minimize diffs
	(only two added lines now)

	* Modules/regexmodule.c: fix core dump when asking a plain regex
	object for a named group

	mods for named subexpressions

	* Include/regexpr.h: moved to Modules/regexpr.h

	* Modules/timingmodule.c: change tests for no arguments

	* configure.in: remove strtoul from AC_REPLACE_FUNCS; remove
	initial blank line (which got copied into configure so it wouldn't
	start with #!/bin/sh as required)

	* Python/compile.c: call mystrto(u)l instrad of strto(u)l

	* Python/Makefile.in: add mystrtoul.c to OBJS

	* Python/mystrtoul.c: renamed from strtol.c; renamed functions to
	mystrto(u)l; this is now a standard source file (since some
	systems have a strto(u)l that doesn't report errors properly)

	* Modules/Setup: added entry for timing module

	* Modules/{timing.h,timingmodule.c}: new files implementing GNN's
	timing module
