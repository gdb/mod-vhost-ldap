* Put back TLS
* general code review (use of per-directory-config ?)
* implement php_admin_flag and php_admin_value setting for vhosts with ldap
* implement directory access control, similar to location
* implement directory/location aliasing between vhosts, based on ldap
* implement logging-related directives for ldap-based vhosts
* implement require group 
* implement use of other authentication methods than basic, including X509, 
and authentication based not only with apacheExtUserObject, but also with 
classic posixAccount/Group, probably with use of other excellent modules
like mod_authz_ldap and others..
* testing with apache 2.2.x
* testers are welcomed, probably some nullpointer and overflows possibility
extists, anyway Apache The Greate works holds the line - I tested some
generated module segfaults, and they doesn't break apache itself, module only.
