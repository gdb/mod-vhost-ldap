These are some programs to work with the SCSI CD-ROM player's audio
interface (see cdaudio(3) in IRIX 4.0[.2?] or higher).  At the moment
the Python code is not very clean, sorry about that...

cdwin.py	A trivial window interface to play a CD over the CD
		player's audio jack.  More functionality is left as an
		excersice to the reader.  Uses module stdwin.

listcd.py	List the table-of-contents of a CD (data CDs will
		appear as a single track).

playcd.py	Read audio data from the CD and play it over the
		Indigo's built-in speker or audio jack.  Uses module al.

sendcd.py	Read audio data from the CD and send it as UDP packets
		over the network (to readcd.py).

readcd.py	Receive UDP packets containing CD audio data (from
		sendcd.py) and play them over the Indigo's built-in
		speaker or audio jack.  Uses module al.  (Doesn't
		actually use module cd.)

Note that to read *data* CD-ROMs you must open /dev/rdsk/dks0d4s7...
