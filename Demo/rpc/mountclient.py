# Mount RPC client -- RFC 1094 (NFS), Appendix A

# This module demonstrates how to write your own RPC client in Python.
# Since there is no RPC compiler for Python (yet), you must first
# create classes derived from Packer and Unpacker to handle the data
# types for the server you want to interface to.  You then write the
# client class.  If you want to support both the TCP and the UDP
# version of a protocol, use multiple inheritance as shown below.

# Unpacker derived class for Mount protocol clients.
# The important types we need to unpack are fhandle, fhstatus,
# mountlist and exportlist; mountstruct, exportstruct and groups are
# used to unpack components of mountlist and exportlist and the
# corresponding functions are passed as function argument to the
# generic unpack_list function.

	# If the reply does not match what you unpack, an exception is
	# raised either during unpacking (if you overrun the buffer)
	# or by end_call() (if you leave values in the buffer).

	# invalid arguments were passed from outside) will also result
	# in exceptions during packing.
