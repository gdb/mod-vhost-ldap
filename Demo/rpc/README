This is a VERY preliminary release of my Python interface to Sun RPC.
It consists of two library modules, xdr.py and rpc.py, and two example
clients, mountclient.py and nfsclient.py, implementing the NFS Mount
protocol and (part of) the NFS protocol, respectively.  There is also
a way to create servers in Python.

To test the nfs client, run it from the shell with something like this:

  python -c 'import nfsclient; nfsclient.test()' hostname [filesystemname]

When called without a filesystemname, it lists the filesystems at the
host (default the local machine).

For hostname, use e.g. wuarchive.wustl.edu or gatekeeper.dec.com (two
hosts that are known to export NFS filesystems with little restrictions).

Note: this was developed for Python 0.9.8beta (not yet released).  I
have tried to put in compatibility hacks for Python 0.9.7beta
(available from ftp.cwi.nl) but I cannot guarantee that it will work
-- if it doesn't, let me know and I'll see what I can do.  In
particular, if you don't have the built-in module "select", UDP
time-outs and retries won't work.
