This directory contains some demonstrations of the thread module.
This module is only available, optionally, for a few platforms: SGI
IRIX 4 and IRIX 5, SunOS 4 (not completely functioning), Solaris 2,
and supposedly any platform that supports Posix Threads (currently
only tested with KSR's implementation).  See ../../Python/thread.c.

These are mostly "proof of concept" type applications:

bug.py		Demonstrate a bug with importing modules in threads.
condition.py	Condition variables test by Tim Peters.
find.py		Parallelized "find(1)" (looks for directories).
Generator.py	Generator class implemented with threads.
telnet.py	Version of ../sockets/telnet.py using threads.
wpi.py		Version of ../scripts/pi.py using threads and stdwin.
