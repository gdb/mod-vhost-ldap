This directory contains some demonstrations of the thread module.
This module is only (optionally) available for the SGI, for now.

These are mostly "proof of concept" type applications:

find.py		Parallelized "find(1)".
Generator.py	Generator class implemented with threads.
telnet.py	Version of ../sockets/telnet.py using threads.
wpi.py		Version of ../scripts/pi.py using threads and stdwin.
