This directory contains a module (dnslib) that implements a DNS
(Domain Name Server) client, plus additional modules that define some
symbolic constants used by DNS (dnstype, dnsclass, dnsopcode).

Type "python dnslib.py -/" for a usage message.

You can also import dnslib and write your own, more sophisticated
client code; use the test program as an example (there is currently no
documentation :-).

NOTE: This code has been evolved into a much more enhanced package by
Anthony Baxter; see the pydns project at SourceForge:
