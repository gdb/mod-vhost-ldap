This directory contains various demonstrations of what you can do with
Python.  The demos are grouped sub(sub*)directories according to
required optional built-in modules.

scripts		Some useful Python scripts that I put in my bin
		directory.  No optional built-in modules meeded.

sockets		Examples for the new built-in module 'socket'.

sgi		Demos that only run on Silicon Graphics machines.
		Require the built-in modules 'audio' and/or 'gl'
		and/or 'stdwin'.
		(This is split in corresponding subdirectories.)

stdwin		Demos that use the STDWIN library.  Require the 'stdwin'
		built-in module.

WARNING: many scripts are executable and have a first line saying

	#! /usr/local/python

This is unlikely to give good results unless you've really installed
the latest version python there.  Edit the first line before
installing such scripts; to try them out, you can just say "python
foo.py" or enter python interactively and say "import foo".
