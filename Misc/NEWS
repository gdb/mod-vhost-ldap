======================================
==> Release 1.4 (sometime 3Q 1996) <==
======================================

XXX This file still has to be updated!

Some highlights:

- "make install" overhaul to install everything and use a version number

- new builtin modules operator, errno

- changes needed by Numeric Python extensions:

	- x[lo:hi:stride]
	- x[a, b, c]
	- x[a, ..., z]

  plus "ellipses" and "slice" objects
